This is a minimalist desktop kanban application.
Basic usage described in built-in "help" board.
Just start it and see ;)
For abuse of emojies install Google Noto Emoji Fonts.
on Void Linux they are known as package "noto-fonts-emoji",
search for correct package's name on your OS.

Nobene5 tested on Void Linux, it also works on FreeBSD 14.
Might work on OpenBSD and maybe on MacOS and NetBSD.
Maybe only some file paths must be adjusted in nobene5.js file.

Installation.
  0) You must install Golang 1.21 and https://github.com/webview/webview_go with dependencies.

  1) $ git clone https://github.com/nobene/nobene5

  2) $ cd nobene5

  3) $ go build

     Copy "nb5" script to your path.
     Later you can adjust default font-size value to your taste in nobene5.css:49,14 .

  4) $ cd ~nobene5 && ./nobene5
     OR
     $ nb5

Pains of installation on openBSD :(
  1) Besides steps described above on OpenBSD you must do more tricks :
     a)
     # ln -s /usr/lib/libc.a /usr/lib/libdl.a 
     (it's a dirty trick, but it works).

    b)
    find in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig files : webkit2gtk-4.0.pc webkit2gtk-web-extension-4.0.pc
    javascriptcoregtk-4.0.pc and from each file (or maybe from some other *.pc files as well)
     delete these flags :
     -Wl,-z,nobtcfi  -Wl,-z,wxneeded

    c)
    set property "wxallowed" to filesystems in /etc/fstab then reboot.

    d)
    $ export CGO_LDFLAGS="-lc"
    $ CGO_ENABLED=1 go build

    e) now you can copy and start via "nb2" as described above in 3) and 4).

    Features.
  Nobene5 is a kanban board.

  On startup it loads "help" board with usage information.

  You can create new board with ++BoardName typed in any card (from the start of 1st string).

  You can clone board  with $$BoardNewName typed in any card. Only board scheme will be cloned,
   but old and new boards will share same set of cards, so editing will change content of same card
   in both boards. Of course later you can add cards to these boards, and they will start to diverge,
   as newly added cards will be unique and not shared.
  Cloning with $$ can also be used for renaming of board with unlucky name. Just clone to better name, then
   delete old board.

  You can load another board with >>BoardName.

  You can save current board with [SAVE] item clicked from main menu.

  You can add new card to the current board with +[] item from main menu ( to 4th column ).

  By doubleclick on card you can get card's menu and switch between 3 views : gray (aka brief), brown-inked-centered and hidden.
  Card will be then shown with chosen view.
  Full view is not implemented yet.
  Close card's menu by doubleclicking on top or bottom string of it.

  You can edit card just by clicking on it and typing/deleting new text from it
   and then by moving pointer out of the card. Card will be saved.

  You can delete card by typing in it ????? and then moving pointer out of the card.

  You can insert emojies into the card from rightclick context menu, if Noto Emoji font is installed
   (this feature does nor work on OpenBSD somehow ?!).

  You can open/close list of all saved boards by clicking on [â‰¡] button,
   located in the bottom right corner of your screen,
   or by clicking on top or bottom string or on middle separator of main menu widget.

  You can clone card with @@DestinationBoard typed inside of any card (type from the start of 1st string).
   Card will be copied without @@* command. This action is truely cloning of one card.
   So later you can safely edit them separately.

  You can delete current board with /DELETE typed in any card .

  You can quit app by closing Nobene5's window (only available safe exit method).

  You can adjust font size of cards with inputs ==42 typed in any card
   (type from the start of 1st string) , where "42" in this example means font size in pixels.
   Default value is 26px. If by mistake you have set size like ==11, then just set it again to higher value.
   this works only during Nobene5's run, so each time you have to set it again after launch
   or you can change it to suitable value in nobene5.css (string 49).

  Nobene5 app has rightclickable context menu with handy copy and paste and emoji items.

  And of course you can drag and drop cards to new position on board.

  Every time you save board, two copies saved : BoardName and BoardName-bup.
  *-bup boards are not shown in the list, but you can load them with >BoardName-bup .
  If you save BoardName-bup, it creates BoardName-bup-bup :)
  So, you can load backup of backup and work on it too.

  Note: Nobene5 does not allow spaces in board name ( it's a feature ),
  max. length of board name is 32 symbols.
  Neither accepted board names with dashes ( it's a bug perhaps ).
  Underscores and pluses in board names are allowed.

Backups.
 For backing up your works just copy entire directory "store" with all of it's content
 somewhere outside of "nobene5" directory tree.
 "store0" directory exists for having "help" board only starting pack,
 just in case you some day might discard  all your prior work and start over again from scratch.
 In such case delete all content inside "store" and copy all from "store0" to "store".
